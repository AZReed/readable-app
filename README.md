## Aknowledgments

This project API was made with Udacity local server in mind. All API calls are local and you need to provide the server for this project to work.
The Udacity local server is provided at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.

To run the server locally, go to 'api-server' folder:
```
npm install
node server
```
